Notes on prolog 

My notes are not the prolog *way*, I come from a OOP / Procedural Language , such that recursive methods are a bit, off to me, Most of my methods would be recalled using some sort of procedural way . 

Feel free to make a pr or some adjustments if you think there are better ways of doing this .
